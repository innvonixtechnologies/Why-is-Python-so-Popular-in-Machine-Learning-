# Why-is-Python-so-Popular-in-Machine-Learning-
There are many reasons why the Python programming language is popular with professionals who work on machine learning systems. One of the main reasons it is popular as a programming language is that it's a great way to learn how to code. It reads almost like plain English and has many features that allow you to write complex tasks very simply. Moreover, there are many applications for which Python is a great option, including data science, AI and machine learning, <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/web-app-development" target="_blank"><b>web development</b></a> and <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/iot-app-development" target="_blank"><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b></a> with devices like the Raspberry Pi.

<b>What is Python programming?</b>

Python is a high-level programming language used for general-purpose software development. It’s a server side language – which means it runs on the server, and is responsible for processing the logic behind user inputs, interacting with databases and other servers, etc.
Python is an open-sourced language like Java and in recent years has increased in popularity due to its use in data science. Python also has a strong community around machine learning, data modeling, data analysis and <a href="https://www.innvonix.com/blog/ar-vr-developer/ai-and-machine-learning-in-software-development" target="_blank"><b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b></a>, with extensive resources and libraries built for these purposes.
And yes, the rumors are true. Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python.

<h2>Why is Python so popular?</h2>

1. One of the best languages when learning to code:

If you're new to coding or you're hoping to get someone you know interested in coding, good on you! Secondly, consider making Python your language of choice. It's one of the easiest programming languages to learn, due to the fact that it reads and writes quite a bit like plain English.
 

In fact, there are many code clubs out in the world that you can join to help teach school kids how to code, and Python is one of the most common tools for this. From little scripts and games to controlling LEDs and robots, there is a lot you can do to make learning fun.

2. Python is heavily used in the Internet of Things:

With the rise of the Internet of Things - small low-power devices that are connected to the internet and can run any custom code - Python has risen to the top for a lot of the devices you can buy and tinker with. Devices like the Raspberry Pi are tiny and connect to a multitude of sensors, displays, lights, robots and more, and allow you to write code to communicate between these parts, as well as send and receive data over Bluetooth, the internet and other communication methods.
While not all of these devices support Python, a lot of them do; either a fully-featured version of Python or Micropython: a subset of Python for simpler devices, so you can still take advantage of the simplicity and productivity of Python without needing the full power it normally requires.

3. Python is instrumental in data science and AI:

Arguably the areas where you find Python the most are data science, AI and machine learning - a subset of AI. Out of the box, Python comes with a lot of built-in libraries that provide a lot of the functionality a data scientist might need. In addition to that, there are also a great number of robust and popular libraries you can download for Python and use in your projects, such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and SciPy for math, data manipulation, data visualization and more.
 
It also can't be underestimated how important Python’s comfort of use is in this field. The fact that Python provides you with the ability to perform advanced calculations with relative ease is really cool. The faster you can get from hypothesis to data analysis, the better.

4. Python is versatile for web development:

Python is incredibly versatile and powerful and this extends to the web as well.
When setting up a web server, you might think of Node.js, .NET or Java, but Python is another great contender. While it lacks some of the performance of the other languages and frameworks, it's easy to get something up and running in Python very quickly and to continue being very productive. The developer experience can outweigh the reduced performance, and scaling your system for performance is becoming easier than ever with cloud services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud etc.
When it comes to frameworks there are two main contenders: <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/"><b>Flask</b></a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a>. Flask is a more minimalist framework that lets you determine how you want to approach the design of your system, which is great for seasoned developers. Django is a more “batteries-included” framework that provides a fairly rigid structure, which is great for beginners and prototyping where you just want to get something up and running very quickly.

Conclusion:

Some point out that ease of use makes for better collaborative coding and implementation, and that as a general-purpose language, Python can do a lot of things easily, which helps with a complex set of machine learning tasks. All of this makes Python a frequently exclusive language skill in the tech world. Another benefit is broad support: Because so many people view as Python as a standard, the support community is large, which builds Python’s popularity even more.
